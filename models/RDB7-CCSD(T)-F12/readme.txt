These models are used to create the results for Table 4 from the corresponding paper. The models inside the "without_pretraining" folder were directly trained on the RDB7-CCSD(T)-F12 dataset without any pre-training. The models inside the "fine-tuned" folder were first pre-trained using the RMG-DB-8 data and then fine-tuned on the RDB7-CCSD(T)-F12 dataset. The models were co-trained to predict ΔΕ0 and ΔH0 in kcal/mol as described in the manuscript.
