These models are used to create the results for Table 5 from the corresponding paper. The models inside the "without_pretraining" folder were directly trained on the RDB19-M06-2X dataset without any pre-training. The models inside the "fine-tuned" folder were first pre-trained using the RMG-DB-8 data and then fine-tuned on the RDB19-M06-2X dataset. The models are co-trained to predict the Gibbs free energy of activation and of reaction in kcal/mol as described in the manuscript.
